<h1>Session 2: Express + io/fs + Handlebars</h1>

<div>Better late than never :) sorry for the delay in writing. The second session took place and time as planned, but the lazy writer did not take place and time as expected.</div>
<div>The goal of this second session was to provide a lightweight and easy way for "automagic" adding of new posts to list of posts. Of course a list of posts has to be presented also.</div>
<div>What we did agree on was that we will use Express for the request-response management, Handlebars for view creation (we want to use it also on client in the future) and that we need to read the posts from disk, therefore we will need to work with io/fs library a bit. </div>
<div>At first we need to install dependencies:</div>

<div>The "big split" in our ways was in the mindset of how we will continue:</div>

<h2>1st approach - Express application generator</h2>

<div>By reading and following http://expressjs.com/starter/generator.html it seemed that there should be an easy way of a quick start solution. From the web, it seemed pretty straight foreward. In my case (Arch Linux), I had to do a sidestep instead of "npm install express-generator -g" and intsall a repository package nodejs-express-generator. I chose --hbs and --git switch. No plans for css preprocessing for now.</div>
<div>The skeleton that got generated was understandable after a short glance here and there. It did not take a long time to find a place where "controllers" are (routes) and where all the views are (views). Common layout was pre-generated, basic logging, favicon support, cookies parser, basic configuration file (to be able to configure and switch dev/production environments from a dedicated file and of course some basic public directory structure. In a matter of .. perhaps half an hour of looking around the code, changing it and removing unneeded stuff, the solution was done.</div>
<div>Problem of this solution and it's final doom was that it was able to do too many things for what we wanted. There was no plan for logging yet, there definitely was no plan for parsing cookies either. And similar went for a bunch of other things. It would take too much time to remove all of this to be worth the effort.</div>
<div>This is why the second approach was a winning one:</div>

<h2>2nd approach - Manual clean and clear way</h2>

<div>In this approach, the aim was to do the least "damage", have the simpliest solution that would cover ther requirements.</div>
<div>First things first, we include all the libraries and register handlebars as a handler for html files:</div>
<pre>
var express = require('express');
var hbs = require('hbs');
var fs = require('fs');

var app = express();
app.set('view engine', 'html');
app.engine('html', hbs.__express);
</pre>
<div>we will need a directory for static files, lets have a "static" dir then:</div>
<pre>
app.use(express.static('static'));
</pre>
<div>Now we need routing .. two basic routes, one (default) for showing a list of posts and one for showing a concrete post:</div>
<pre>
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
  // show list of posts here
});
app.get('/posts/:file', function(req, res) {
  // show concrete post (file) in this one
});
</pre>
<div>For the first route, we want to read a directory with posts and show a list of these "files" in a form of links to the concrete posts:</div>
<pre>
app.get('/', function(req, res) {
    fs.readdir('posts', function(err, files){
        res.render('index.html', { posts: files });
    });
});
</pre>
<div>At first we read the contents of "posts" directory and in the callback method, we render the index.html handlebars template with input parameter "posts" that has a value of array of filenames.</div>
<div>Now to the second route, loading of concrete post:</div>
<pre>
app.get('/posts/:file', function(req, res) {
    fs.readFile('posts/'+ req.params.file, function(err, content){                                                                                                                                                  
        res.render('post.html', {title: req.params.file, content: content });
    });
});
</pre>
<div>The :file in route will fill in params.file (or params['file'], whichever you prefer) with the value that was requested by the user. This file we will try to read from our posts directory and in a callback, render post.html template with two parameters: title and content. The title will be the filename requested and content, the content of that file. As a warning, never trust any user input, bad things can come in and this code does not deal with them properly.</div>
<br />
<div>Now that we see how we can build the routes, lets build the views with handlebars. A simple main page template will have in body something like this:</div>
<pre>
        &lt;ul&gt;
            {{#each posts}}&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="posts/{{this}}"&gt;{{this}}&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;{{/each}}
        &lt;/ul&gt;
</pre>
<div>For each item in the posts array we render a proper link to the concrete post.</div>
<div>The final stage is to show the post itself, a template will have something like this inside:</div>
<pre>
    &lt;body&gt;
        {{{content}}}
    &lt;/body&gt;
</pre>
<div>Where the {{{ prevents the handlebars engine to act "safe" and will display all the dangerous code that the author of the blog post wanted to share with us (this includes any type of html).</div>

<div>And that's where the second session ends. Next time stay tuned for logging and error handling.</div>
<div>See you soon</div>
